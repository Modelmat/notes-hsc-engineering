Historical Developments in Transport Systems
--------------------------------------------

Bike
^^^^

* First bicycle: Karl Drais (1817) made the Draisine. It had no pedals.

* Ernest Michauux in 1861 added pedals to the front wheel.
  However, this setup was unstable and did not take off.

* In 1873 James Starley created the Penny Farthing, with the large front wheel.
  As the rider sat atop the wheel with pedals, they were able to balance easier.

* In 1885, John Starley created the "safety bicycle".
  This had brakes, pedals on the back wheel, and was much lower than the Penny Farthing.
  This made it much safer, and it is essentially the same design as used in bikes today.

Effects of Engineering Innovation in Transport on Society
---------------------------------------------------------

Cities began as compact residential areas surrounding commercial and industrial land, as people could only walk.
Through the 1800s and early 1900s, railroads allowed for cities to expand along railway lines.
Buses and trams allowed for the areas between train stations to be filled in with residential.
Growing car ownership Post-WW2 allowed for infilling of areas between train lines, as well as suburbanisation.
Suburbs promised quarter-acre blocks of land, larger households, and quieter areas away from dirty inner-city.

Public transport provides increased accessibility and decreased traffic compared to cars.

* Draisine: Only rich people could afford it as it was expensive; it was also heavy and slow.
  Hence it had limited effect on society as a whole.
* In 1920s/30s, bikes became cheaper, widely available, and reliable.
  This meant more people, *notably women* could use it to travel to work.
* Post WW2, bikes were accessible to kids as a toy and exercise.
